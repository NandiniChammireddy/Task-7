Part 1: Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)
  Objective Learned:
Understand how to reduce complex, high-dimensional data into a simpler 2D form while retaining the most important information.
What Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is and why itâ€™s used.
How to apply PCA on datasets with multiple features (e.g., the Iris dataset).
How to visualize data in 2D after PCA using scatter plots.
How dimensionality reduction can help with pattern recognition and data interpretation.

 Part 2: Stock Price Prediction (Time Series with ARIMA)
  Objective Learned:
Learn to forecast stock prices using historical data and time series models.
How to preprocess time series data (date parsing, handling missing values).
How to explore trends, seasonality, and patterns in financial data.
How to create lag and rolling average features to improve prediction accuracy.
How to build and tune an ARIMA model for time series forecasting.
How to evaluate your model using metrics like:
MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
How to visualize the actual vs. predicted stock prices to understand forecasting accuracy.
